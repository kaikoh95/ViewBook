# ViewBook
Simple iOS application showing a reloadable Table View while fetching new user profiles. Able to click into each cell to view more details of a user.

To use:
- Run pod install
- Double click on .xcworkspace (not .xcodeproj)
- Build then run as usual

Notable bugs:
- Have to click the Load More button twice before the first reloading of data appears.
- Have to click and hold on a cell before releasing it in order to view the detailed information of that cell.
